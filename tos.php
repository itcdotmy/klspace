        <p><strong>Unlimited Web Hosting</strong></p> 
        <p align="justify">When we say unlimited domains, unlimited disk space and bandwidth, of course there are terms & conditions that you must adhere to. This means unlimited webpages, domains and web graphics, not downloads or streaming media. Our servers are shared hosting servers and memory and CPU usage is not unlimited. CPU intensive files are not permitted on our servers and accounts may not to be used to host a collection of mp3s, audios, videos, anime, .rar files, Warez, gamers sites, shout cast and similar, or to backup your computer or another source. They may not be used for general storage of any type. They may not be used as download mirrors or download/upload portals. While the sale of eBooks and other legal small download files are permitted within reason (see download files below) with the unlimited package, hosting and storage of mass quantities where our servers are used as a distribution point is not permitted.<br />
        They may not be used for HYIP (High Yield Investment Programs), Ponzi schemes or pyramid schemes. They may not be used to provide proxy servers. All content stored on a reseller account must be directly used on the Internet by the website associated with that account. These accounts may not be used as a download distribution point for your software or media. They are to be used for standard web practices only. This means that all content stored on an unlimited account must be used for "acceptable" website use. “Unacceptable” usage is anything that a shared server would not be able to provide under standard circumstances and uses a high percentage of CPU or Memory (10%+) usage.
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>Free Hosting</strong></p> 
        <p align="justify">Free hosting is not permitted with unlimited packages, if you intend to offer free domain-based hosting, please choose one of our metered packages. With unlimited packages free hosting is only permitted within reason when the user has their own domain. Sub-domain hosting is only permitted within reason, and your clients are expected to have their own domain. Our servers are intended to host websites offering products and a service, if you are giving away free hosting space that is compromising our business customers, we reserve the right to request that you switch to a metered package.<br />
